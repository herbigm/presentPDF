# PresentPDF
This is a simple viewer for PDF presentations (for example made with LaTeX beamer) for a presenter view. One Fullsize window will show the current slife, while on the other screen the previous and next slide as well as a timer can be seen.

This package uses Icons from the KDE breeze-icons as fallback: https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons. The files *open.svg*, *printPreview.svg* and *printToPDF.svg* are par of the breeze-icons theme and not of this program.

## Depencies
* Qt5
* poppler

## Further development
There is no further development planned. I'd like to spread the idea of this program. Feel free to fork this project!
